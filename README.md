# Local-Store-Customer-Analytics

* The project explores concepts such as the fundamental marketing modeling theory segmentation, positioning, and price elasticity.

* Customer Analytics Segmentation: This part focuses on customer segmentation. It involves the application of hierarchical and flat clustering techniques for dividing customers into groups. It also features applying the Principal Components Analysis (to reduce the dimensionality of the problem), as well as combining PCA and K means for an even more professional customer segmentation.

* Purchase Analytics: (Both descriptive and predictive analytics files) explores both the descriptive and predictive analysis of the purchase behaviour of customers, including models for purchase incidence, brand choice, and purchase quantity by analysing the Price elasticities for each and deriving insights.
